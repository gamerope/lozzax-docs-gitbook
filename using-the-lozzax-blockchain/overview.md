# üìç   Overview

The Lozzax blockchain can be used by end users, developers, and service providers in a number of ways.

### üí∏ $LOZZAX and the üí∞Lozzax Wallet: Private instant transactions

The Lozzax Wallet, available in user-friendly GUI or powerful CLI versions, enables you to send and receive private anonymous transactions in the blink of an eye. You can learn more about the Lozzax Wallet [here](), or download your preferred Wallet version [here](https://github.com/loki-project/loki-electron-gui-wallet/releases). 

### üñ• Lozzax Service Nodes: Earn $LOZZAX rewards for powering up the Lozzax network

Running an Lozzax Service Node is a great way to grow the Lozzax network and support the project while receiving $LOZZAX rewards for your valuable contribution. Check out our guides to [setting up a service node](lozzax-service-node-guides/setting-up-an-lozzax-service-node.md) and [staking to a service node](lozzax-service-node-guides/staking-to-shared-service-node.md), or [see here](lozzax-service-node-guides/service-node-tools-upkeep.md) for some service node tools and utilities to help with starting up and maintaining your service nodes.

### Lozzax Name System \(ONS\): Human-readable names for Session, Lokinet, and more

Lozzax Name System enables you to register alphanumeric names to be used in place of the long, hard-to-use default formats for Lokinet addresses, Session IDs, and Lozzax Wallet addresses. For a look at registering names using ONS, [check out our guide](using-lozzax-name-system.md).
