# ðŸ“± Mobile Wallet Staking Guide

This guide explains how to stake to an Lozzax Service Node via the Lozzax Mobile Wallet

The latest versions of the Lozzax Mobile Wallet can be found on [our downloads page](../../downloads.md).

### Step 1.

Open the Lozzax Mobile Wallet, enter your password/pin, and let it fully sync to the latest blockheight.

### Step 2. 

Press the icon in the top right of the screen to open the menu.

### Step 3. 

Press "Start Staking" in the menu.

### Step 4. 

Search for nodes that are awaiting contribution on [https://lozzaxsn.com](https://lozzaxsn.com/status/awaiting_contribution).

### Step 5. 

Copy the service node public key into the box at the top of the screen labelled 'Service Node Key'

### Step 6. 

Enter the amount of Lozzax you wish to stake in the other box. The minimum stake amount will be listed on [https://lozzaxsn.com](https://lozzaxsn.com/status/awaiting_contribution), but to work it out yourself you can simply divide the amount of Lozzax available to stake by the number of slots left for that Service Node.

For example, if a node had 2 slots remaining and 7500 Lozzax available for stake, the minimum contribution would be 7500/2 = 3750 Lozzax.

### Step 7. 

Once you have entered the Service Node public key and the amount you wish to stake, simply swipe 'Stake Lozzax' to contribute to the Service Node.

Congratulations! You're all staked up, and you'll receive your Service Node rewards directly to your wallet. 

### Unstaking

To unlock your stake from a Service Node, navigate to the stakes section of the wallet your contributions will be listed. You can unstake and contribution by swiping left and confirming. Your Lozzax will be unlocked after 15 days.
