# ðŸ’° Lozzax Wallet & Guides

_Just looking for the latest Lozzax Wallet releases?_ [_Head to our downloads page_](https://github.com/lozzax/lozzax-electron-gui-wallet/releases)_._

The Lozzax Wallet is your gateway to private decentralised transactions and communications. It allows you to hold and secure your $LOZZAX, stake into Lozzax Service Nodes, and transact with $LOZZAX.

The Lozzax wallet stores a collection of public and private keys which can be used to receive, view, or spend $LOZZAX.

The wallet uses these private keys through a daemon which synchronises with the Lozzax network to scan for incoming transactions and send outgoing transactions.

### Graphical User Interface \(GUI\) Wallet

It has a graphical interface \(like most PC applications\), which is perfect for beginners or those just looking to store and send their Lozzax.
