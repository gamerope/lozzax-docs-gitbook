# ðŸš€ Accessing SNApps

Accessing SNApps is as simple as [installing Lokinet](https://lokinet.org/), opening your browser of choice, and entering the SNApp's .loki address in the address bar!

## Test services

Jump into a browser such as Chrome or Firefox and enter the following SNApp address:

* [http://dw68y1xhptqbhcm5s8aaaip6dbopykagig5q5u1za4c7pzxto77y.loki/wiki/](http://dw68y1xhptqbhcm5s8aaaip6dbopykagig5q5u1za4c7pzxto77y.loki/wiki/)

This should take you to the Lokinet Wiki, hosted within Lokinet. If this SNApp works, you have full Lokinet access!
