# ðŸ—£ Open group setup

Open groups are Session group chat servers that can host many thousands of chat participants. This guide explains how to set up a Session open group.

> Note: Open groups provide transit encryption, but open group messages are not encrypted while stored on the open group server, making **closed groups** \(which can be created within Session itself\) a better solution for high-security communications with groups of 100 or less people.

Open groups are based on an express REST API for serving persistent-history public chat rooms. Open groups are unlimited in size, as they are hosted by your own server. Please be aware these are **public** groups, and highly sensitive private information **should not be shared in this group format.**

Open group servers are run by 2 daemons: the platform server, providing an ADN standard REST API, and another daemon with Session-specific behaviors \(crypto-key registration and enhanced moderation functions\).

## Installation

**Note:** .debs for the Session Open Group server are currently only available for Ubuntu 20.04.  
For other operating systems, you can either [build from source](https://github.com/nielsandriesse/session-open-group-server/blob/main/BUILDING.md) or use [Docker](https://github.com/nielsandriesse/session-open-group-server/blob/main/DOCKER.md).

### 1. Pull in the Session open group server executable

Pull in the Session Open Group Server executable by running the following commands

```text
sudo curl -so /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/lozzax.gpg https://deb.lozzax.io/pub.gpg
echo "deb https://deb.lozzax.io $(lsb_release -sc) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/lozzax.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install session-open-group-server
sudo chown _loki /var/lib/session-open-group-server -R
```

### 2. Add a room

Add a room of your choice with the following command:

```text
session-open-group-server --add-room {room_id} {room_name}
```

`room_id` must be lowercase and consist of only letters, numbers and underscores.

For **example:**

```text
session-open-group-server --add-room fish FishingAustralia
```

### 3. Print your server's URL

Print the URL users can use to join rooms on your open group server by running:

```text
session-open-group-server --print-url
```

This will output a result similar to:

```text
http://[host_name_or_ip]/[room_id]?public_key=2054fa3271f27ec9e55492c85d022f9582cb4aa2f457e4b885147fb913b9c131
```

You will need to replace `[host_name_or_ip]` with the IP address of your VPS or the domain mapping to your IP address, and `[room_id]` with the ID of one of the rooms you created earlier.

For **example**:

```text
http://116.203.217.101/fish?public_key=2054fa3271f27ec9e55492c85d022f9582cb4aa2f457e4b885147fb913b9c131
```

This URL can then be used to join the group inside the Session app.

### 4. Make yourself a moderator

Make yourself a moderator using the following command:

```text
session-open-group-server --add-moderator {your_session_id} {room_id}
```

For **example**:

```text
session-open-group-server --add-moderator 05d871fc80ca007eed9b2f4df72853e2a2d5465a92fcb1889fb5c84aa2833b3b40 fish
```

### 5. Add an image for your new room \(Optional\)

* Add your room on Session desktop using the URL printed earlier
* Use Session desktop to upload a picture for your room

Or

* Upload a JPG to your VPS
* Put it in `/var/lib/session-open-group-server/files`
* Rename it to `{room_id}` \(no file extension\)

### Customization

The default options the Session open group server runs with should be fine in most cases, but if you like you can run on a custom port or host, specify the path to the X25519 key pair you want to use, etc. To do this, simply add [the right arguments](https://github.com/nielsandriesse/session-open-group-server/blob/main/BUILDING.md#step-3-run-it) to the `ExecStart` line in your systemd service file \(normally located under `/etc/systemd/system`\) and restart your service using:

```text
systemctl restart session-open-group-server.service
```
