# ðŸ’¸ Staking to a shared Oxen Service Node

This document explains how to stake via the Oxen GUI Wallet.

The latest version of the wallet can be downloaded [here](../../downloads.md).

Please keep in mind, one can **only stake via an open pool with the GUI wallet**.

## Step 1

Open the Oxen GUI Wallet, enter your password, and let it fully sync to the latest blockheight.

## Step 2

Click on the `SERVICE NODE` button.

## Step 3

On this step you will need to enter the service node public key obtained from the node operator \(or [OxenBlocks](https://lokiblocks.com/service_nodes)\) and the amount of Oxen you are contributing to the node.

## Step 4

Once that is filled out, simply hit the `STAKE` button.

> Please note, if you receive an error at this step you will need to click the `SWEEP ALL` before you can stake from your wallet.

Congratulations, you're now staked!
