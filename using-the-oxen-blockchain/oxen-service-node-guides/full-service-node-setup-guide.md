# 🍺 Full service node setup guide

This guide will walk you through the complete process of setting up, staking, and running an Lozzax Service Node. This guide is targeted at non-developers, so even if you're new to Linux or the command line, you should be able to follow along without any trouble.

You can run the Lozzax Service Node software on any device running a supported operating system, but for the purposes of this guide, we're assuming you're setting up a service node on a remote Ubuntu or Debian server. If you're new to Linux and running servers in general, this is the best way to go. If you're more experienced and would prefer to run your service node on a different operating system, you'll need to modify the syntax of some commands to suit your selected OS.

### Running an Lozzax Service Node: Requirements

These are the basic requirements for running a service node. These requirements may change in future, so keep an eye on [the Lozzax blog](https://lozzax.io/blog) or join our [Telegram community](https://t.me/Lozzax_Community) and [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/67GXfD6) for all the latest updates.

| Spec | Requirement |
| :--- | :--- |
| Latest Lozzax Service Node software | Latest service node debs \(installed through the steps below\) or latest [binaries](https://github.com/lozzax-io/loki-core/releases) |
| Server operating system | Ubuntu 18.04+ or Debian 10+ |
| Storage | 30GB |
| RAM | 2-4GB \(2GB at absolute minimum\) |

> Note: It is possible for an experienced system administrator to run a service node on a server running an operating system other than Ubuntu or Debian. However, this requires additional work to start up and manage the required service node services, and is beyond the scope of this guide.

## Lozzax Service Nodes in a nutshell

* Service nodes start as full nodes on the Lozzax network
* Full nodes become service nodes when the owner locks the required amount of $LOZZAX and submits a registration transaction
* Once accepted by the network, a service node begins completing service node operations and becomes eligible to receive periodic block rewards in the form of $LOZZAX tokens
* [Multiple participants can stake into one service node](staking-to-shared-service-node.md) and can have the reward automatically distributed

### Service node functionality

Service nodes:

* Receive, store, and forward encrypted [Session](../../products-built-on-lozzax/session/) messages
* Route [Lokinet](../../products-built-on-lozzax/lokinet/) internet traffic
* Monitor other service nodes and vote on their performance
* Are called into quorums which give them authority over [Blink](../../about-the-lozzax-blockchain/blink-instant-transactions.md) transactions
* Produce new blocks for the network via [Pulse PoS](../../about-the-lozzax-blockchain/pulse-pos-on-lozzax/)

## Service node setup for new users

This guide is geared towards users unfamiliar with servers and the command line.

### Step 1: Getting a server

Choosing where to set up your service node is the biggest choice you will make when running a node. There are a number of factors to consider. Because you will be locking up funds as part of operating your service node, you will want to ensure that your server has:

* A stable, relatively fast connection \(100Mbps or better\) to route messages and data quickly
* A minimum of 2GB of RAM, to run the service node software reliably
* At least 30GB of storage space, used to store a local copy of the blockchain
* Redundant power, as found in most data centres. If your server goes down while staked, your service node could be [kicked off the network](service-node-deregistration.md) and you could have your funds locked for 30 days \(without receiving rewards\)

We strongly recommend against running a service node from home. Most home internet connections are relatively slow \(especially for uploads — service nodes need high speeds for both uploading and downloading data\) and typically don't offer static IP addresses, which are required by service nodes. Connection speed and support aside, issues like power outages can easily disrupt home servers, which could result in your service node being kicked from the network.

Typically, the easiest and cheapest way to host a server such as an Lozzax Service Node is to rent a Virtual Private Server \(VPS\). There are thousands of options when it comes to VPS providers, but any of the providers and configurations listed below will do.

| Hosting Provider | Product Name | Cost Per Month \($USD\) | Bandwidth Provided | Accepts $LOZZAX? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Netcup | VPS 1000 G8 | 10.50 | 30 - 35 MiB’s |  |
| Evolution Host | STARTER | 5.50 | 9 - 1 MiB’s | [YES](https://evolution-host.com/vps-hosting.php?package=Loki) |
| Online.net | Start-2-S-SSD | 13.99 | 15 - 17 MiB’s |  |
| Scaleway | START1-M | 9.33 | 20 - 25 MiB’s |  |
| OVH | VPS SSD 2 | 7.61 | 9 - 1 MiB’s |  |
| Leaseweb | Virtual Server XL | 34.45 | 30 - 35 MiB’s |  |
| Digital Ocean | 2 GB, 2 vCPUs | 15 | 9 - 11 MiB’s |  |
| Feral Hosting | Neon Capability | 19.68 | 9 - 11 MiB’s |  |
| Trabia | VDS-8G | 38.54 | 9 - 11 MiB’s |  |
| Hetzner | EX41-SSD \(30 TB\) | 39.71 | 40 - 80 MiB’s |  |

> Note: We do not officially endorse any of these providers. The above list is simply an example of some of the options currently available as of time of writing.

Don't just pick the first VPS from the list, either. Do some digging and see which one looks the best to you, fits best into your budget, and what the latency \(lag between sending a command and the server responding to it\) would be like for you based on the location of the server.

When selecting your VPS’ operating system, choose Ubuntu 20.04 or Debian 10 if you want to follow the steps below verbatim. If you feel more confident and/or wish to run your server on another Linux distribution, the commands in this guide will still apply, but may need to be modified to suit your chosen operating system.

### Step 2: Preparing your server

Every provider has a slightly different way of issuing you access to your new VPS. Most will send an email with the IP address, root username, and a root password to the VPS.

To access your server, you will need an SSH client for your operating system. Because we’re on Windows today, we’ll download PuTTY. Mac users can also use PuTTY. If you’re a Linux user, you probably don’t need us to tell you where to get an SSH client.

To connect to your VPS, you'll need to paste the provided IP address into the SSH client’s “Host Name \(or IP address\)” input box and click the “Open” button. The Port number can usually just be left as `22`.

A terminal window will now appear, prompting you for your log-in details, username \(`root`\) and password, as provided by your VPS provider. When entering your password, characters will not appear in the terminal. This is normal. Hit enter after typing or pasting your password, and you should be logged in to your VPS.

> Note: After logging in for the first time, the VPS may prompt you for a new password for the root account. The terminal will require you to enter the new password twice before you can start running commands. If you aren't prompted for a new `root` password but want to change it anyway, type `sudo passwd`. Choose something very secure!

### **2.1: Hot tips for using the console on Windows**

Consoles don't quite work like the rest of your computer. Here are some basic tips for navigating your way around the command line!

* Don't try copying something by using the usual Ctrl + C hotkey! If you want to copy something, do so by highlighting text and then right clicking it and selecting Copy. Pasting works by right clicking a blank area in the console and selecting Paste.
* If you want to kill a process or stop something from running, press Ctrl + C. \(This is why you shouldn't try copying something with this hotkey!\)
* You can always check the directory you are in by typing `pwd,` and you can list its contents by typing `ls`.
* You can always return to your home directory by typing `cd`and pressing Enter.
* You can move into a given directory by typing `cd <name>` or move back up one level by typing `cd ..`.
* PuTTY allows you to easily duplicate or restart a session by right clicking the top of the window. Handy if you’re trying to do a few things at once.

### **2.2: Server preparation continued**

Next, update your package lists _\(the lists that tell your server which software is available for install or upgrade\)_. The following command downloads package lists from their respective package repositories and "updates" them to get information on the newest versions of packages and their dependencies. It will do this for all repositories and PPAs.

```text
sudo apt update
```

You'll notice a bunch of package lists were downloaded. Once this is complete run the below command to fetch new versions of any packages that came preinstalled on the system.

```text
sudo apt upgrade
```

You'll be prompted to authorise the use of disk space. Type `y` and Enter to authorise.

If you are prompted during the upgrade that a new version of any file is available then click the up and down arrows until you are hovering over `install the package maintainer’s version` and click enter.

Alright, good to go. Our server is now set up, up to date, and is not running as root. On to the fun part!

### 2.3: Firewall Configuration

If you are using a firewall then ensure that the following ports are open/reachable

* Port 22020 \(storage server to storage server\)
* Port 22021 \(client to storage server\)
* Port 22022 \(blockchain syncing\)
* Port 22025 \(service node to service node\)
* Port 1090 \(UDP, not TCP, unlike all of the above; Lokinet router data\)

### Step 3: Initial repository setup

You only need to do this step the first time you want to set up the Lozzax repository; when you've done it once, the repository will automatically update whenever you fetch new system updates.

To add the apt repository, run the following commands.

This first command installs the public key used to sign the Lozzax Service Node packages:

```text
sudo curl -so /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/lozzax.gpg https://deb.lozzax.io/pub.gpg
```

The second command tells `apt` where to find the packages. **Note:** Replace `<DISTRO>`with the appropriate value to match your operating system. If your VPS is running Ubuntu 20.04 as recommended for this guide, replace `<DISTRO>` with `focal`.

Otherwise, to check your `<DISTRO>` , run the following command: `lsb_release -sc`

Alternatively, your `<DISTRO>` can be found by using the following list:

* sid      \(Debian testing/unstable\)
* buster   \(Debian 10\)
* bionic   \(Ubuntu 18.04\)
* focal     \(Ubuntu 20.04\)
* groovy    \(Ubuntu 20.10\)

```text
echo "deb https://deb.lozzax.io <DISTRO> main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/lozzax.list
```

Then resync your package repositories with:

```text
sudo apt update
```

### Step 4: Lozzax Service Node installation and operation

To install the software needed to run a service node, simply install the `lozzax-service-node` package:

```text
sudo apt install lozzax-service-node
```

This will detect your public IP \(or allow you to enter it yourself\) and automatically update the /etc/lozzax/lozzax.conf configuration file with the necessary additional settings to run a service node.

> Note: This process can take up to 6 hours for the blockchain to fully sync.

If you encounter an error during the syncing process due to a 15000 millisecond ping, you can run this command to fix it:

```text
sudo systemctl restart lozzax-node.service
```

### 4.1: Interacting with the running lozzaxd

If you run the `lozzaxd` command with an appended lozzaxd command \(note that `sudo` is not required!\), the `lozzaxd` command forwards this instruction to the running `lozzaxd`. So, for example, to get the current `lozzaxd` status you can run you would run:

```text
lozzaxd status

lozzaxd print_sn_status
```

To see the output log of your node you can run the following command:

```text
journalctl -u lozzax-node -af
```

This is useful to see if your node is syncing with the blockchain and to see other diagnostic messages that may come up from time to time. \(Press Ctrl-C to stop watching the log\).

For a full list of supported commands run:

```text
lozzaxd help
```

You can also get basic statistics \(such as uptime proof and ping times\) on the running daemons from the `systemctl status` commands:

```text
systemctl status lozzax-node
systemctl status lozzax-storage-server
systemctl status lokinet-router
```

### Step 5: Service node registration

This section of the guide is split into two parts:

* If you are an individual staker and do not require any other contributors to run your service node, jump into the [Individual staking ](full-service-node-setup-guide.md#6-1-individual-staking)section.
* If you want to run a pooled Service Node, jump into [Setting up a pooled service node](full-service-node-setup-guide.md#6-2-setting-up-a-pooled-service-node).

### **5.0.1: Retrieving your wallet address**

You'll need your wallet address to register your service node. Copy your primary address from the Lozzax GUI wallet, or run the `address` command from within the Lozzax CLI wallet, and copy the output.

> Note: Do not use subaddresses for staking. Subaddresses are currently unsupported for staking in the Lozzax wallet.

### **5.1: Individual staking**

To run a service node as the sole contributor, you'll need:

* A fully synchronized, up-to-date Lozzax daemon running on your service node
* An Lozzax wallet with at least 15,000 $LOZZAX in it \(to meet the 15,000 $LOZZAX staking requirement to register your service node\)

### 5.1.1: Preparing your node for registration

Log in \(if not already logged in\) to the VPS running the service node, then run the following command:

```text
lozzaxd prepare_registration
```

The daemon will output the current staking requirement \(15,000 $LOZZAX\) and prompt you with an input to clarify whether you are an individual staker or you will be running a pool. Type `y` and click enter, as you will be the sole staker.

The daemon will now prompt you for the operator's \(your\) Lozzax address — this is the address saved in Step 5. Retrieve this address, copy it, then paste it into the terminal and press Enter.

The daemon will now ask for a final confirmation. If you agree with the information provided, type `y` and click enter.

The daemon will output a command which looks similar to:

```text
register_service_node 4294967292 T6TCCyDgjjbddtzwNGryRJ5HntgGYvqZTagBb2mtHhn7WWz7i5JDeqhFiHqu7ret56411ZJS7Thfeis718bVteBZ2UA6Y7G2d 4294967292 100.000000000 1535677391 ec3895ea70a4a91b5ec4b5e1df96a45e07046f1fb0123c754d98fb2d70f4529d 5bb35d7b8ab1acb943bc47913ada8f9d2e6d6e22264e57484a04c1bbfd461f0ee2e5435454cd9b7059b221eb506ce9ea4537ddd9faf1f1757e0ef611a41c0609
```

> _NOTE: You must run the command which **your** daemon outputs, and **not** the command shown above._

### 5.1.2: Registering your service node

To stake and register your service node, open your Lozzax GUI wallet \(with a balance of at least 15,000 $LOZZAX\). Navigate to the Service Nodes tab, then the Registration subsection. Paste the `register_service_node` command from Step 5.1.1 above, and click **Register Service Node**.

If you're using the Lozzax CLI wallet, simply paste the registration command directly into the CLI wallet prompt and hit Enter.

Well done! Continue to [Step 6: Service node check](full-service-node-setup-guide.md#step-6-service-node-status-check) to make sure your service node is running properly.

### **5.2: Setting up a pooled service node**

### _**Minimum contribution rules**_

The service node staking requirement is fixed at a flat 15,000 $LOZZAX total. Service nodes accept at most 4 contributions, meaning the minimum contribution to a service node is `<Remaining Staking Requirement> ➗ <Number of Remaining Contributors>`.

When setting up reserved spots in a pooled service node, the node administrator \(you\) must ensure the reserved stake amounts each meet the minimum staking requirement; contributors then simply stake their reserved amounts.

### **5.2.1: Pool operator**

The operator \(you\) is the individual who will be hosting the pool and running the server hosting the service node, thus incurring the operating expenses involved in running a node.

To be an operator, you'll need to have:

* A server running a fully synchronized, up-to-date `lozzaxd`
* An Lozzax wallet with at least 3750 $LOZZAX \(to meet the minimum service node operator staking requirement\)
* 1-3 other contributors who also have an Lozzax wallet \(either the CLI or GUI wallet\) with enough $LOZZAX to meet their portion of the total stake
* If the operator wants to reserve contribution spots for specific contributors, the operator will need the addresses of the contributors and the amounts the 1-3 contributors will stake.

If you have the above ready, we can now prepare the service node.

Log in \(if not already logged in\) to the VPS running the service node, then run the following command:

```text
lozzaxd prepare_registration
```

`lozzaxd` will prompt you to specify if you will contribute the entire stake. Because you're running a pooled service node, type `n` and press Enter.

Next, `lozzaxd` will request input for your desired operator fee. This value, which can be between 0-100, represents the percentage of the reward the operator will receive **before** the reward is distributed to all shareholders \(including you!\). For example, if you want to set up a 10% operator cut, you would type `10` and press Enter.

> For example, imagine a service node with 4 contributors, including the operator, all staking equal amounts \(25%\). If the operator specified a 10% fee at this step, they would automatically receive 10% of the service node rewards, and the remaining 90% would then be split equally between the operator and the other 3 contributors.

The terminal will now display the minimum reserve the operator can contribute, and request input for the amount \(in Lozzax\) you, as the operator, wish to contribute. Type your desired `<operator contribution>` and click return.

Once you've set your desired stake amount, you'll be prompted to either reserve spots for individuals that have already agreed to stake into the service node, or leave the pool open for anyone to contribute.

### **Option one: Reserved pool**

If you want to reserve spots for specific contributors, type `y` at this prompt and click return.

The terminal will now prompt you for the number of additional contributors you've organised to stake into this Service Node. Type in the number of reserved contributors, **not including yourself**, and press Enter.

The daemon will now prompt you for the operator's \(your\) Lozzax address — this is the address saved in Step 5. Retrieve this address, copy it, then paste it into the terminal and press Enter.

Next, you need to input the amount of Lozzax each contributor will stake, and the Lozzax Walled Address of the specific contributor\(s\).

> _NOTE: It is possible to reserve only some of the required total stake for specific contributors, while leaving the remaining staking amount open for other contributors._

The daemon will display a summary of the information you've entered. This is your chance for a final check over to make sure the correct information has been entered. To confirm the information is correct, type `y` and press Enter.

### **Option two: Open pool**

If the operator wishes to leave their pool complete open to contributions they should type `n` at the reservation prompt and type Enter. The terminal will prompt you to input your address. Once your address has been entered, the terminal will display the remaining portion that needs to be contributed by others. If you agree, click `y` and hit return.

The daemon will display a summary of the information you've entered. This is your chance for a final check over to make sure the correct information has been entered. To confirm the information is correct, type `y` and press Enter.

### Step 5.2.2: Registering your shared service node

Regardless of which option \(closed or open\) you've gone with, the daemon will output a command which looks similar to:

```text
register_service_node 4294967292 T6TCCyDgjjbddtzwNGryRJ5HntgGYvqZTagBb2mtHhn7WWz7i5JDeqhFiHqu7ret56411ZJS7Thfeis718bVteBZ2UA6Y7G2d 4294967292 100.000000000 1535677391 ec3895ea70a4a91b5ec4b5e1df96a45e07046f1fb0123c754d98fb2d70f4529d 5bb35d7b8ab1acb943bc47913ada8f9d2e6d6e22264e57484a04c1bbfd461f0ee2e5435454cd9b7059b221eb506ce9ea4537ddd9faf1f1757e0ef611a41c0609
```

> _NOTE: You must run the command which **your** daemon outputs, and **not** the command shown above._

Copy the whole line of text in your daemon and paste it into your notepad, as you'll need to run this command from within your Lozzax GUI \(or CLI\) wallet.

You have 2 weeks from the moment of registering the Service Node to run the `register_service_node` command, however it is advised to do it as soon as possible.

Before you disconnect from your VPS, run the following command:

```text
lozzaxd print_sn_key
```

This will output a bunch of information about your service node, but there's one part we're interested in at this stage: the long string of random letters and numbers after the characters `SN:` . This string is your service node's public key, used to identify your service node on the list of registered and operational service nodes. Select and copy the public key \(do not copy any of the surrounding information\).

On your local machine, open your Lozzax GUI or CLI wallet and make sure your wallet contains at least 15,000 $LOZZAX to meet the service node staking requirement. Once you're in your wallet and have checked the balance, run the command which was provided above when you ran the `prepare_registration` command. The wallet will prompt you to confirm your password, then the amount of $LOZZAX to stake. Confirm this by typing `y` and clicking enter.

Once this command completes, your staking transaction will be sent to be included on the blockchain. It may take a few minutes for the transaction to be mined into a block; you can check the status using the following command:

```text
lozzaxd print_sn_status
```

You can also check your node's status by looking for your `<Service Node Public Key>` in the "Service Nodes Awaiting Contributions" section on [the Lozzax block explorer](https://lozzax.observer/).

Once the service node registration is received, you can send the `<Service Node Public Key>` to your contributors, along with the amount of $LOZZAX they are required to stake.

At this point, you'll need to wait until all contributors have staked before the service node activates and becomes eligible to begin receiving rewards.

### **Staking to a shared node as a contributor**

For a guide on staking to a shared Lozzax Service Node as a contributor, [see here.](staking-to-shared-service-node.md)

### Step 6: Service node status check

After you've staked to your service node \(or after all contributors have staked, if you're running a shared node\), you'll need to check if your service node's public key is on the list of service nodes which are operational on the network. This will prove that your service node is running, recognised, and eligible to receive rewards.

Connect to the VPS where the service node is running and run the following command to retrieve your service node's public key:

```text
lozzaxd print_sn_key
```

This will output a long string of letters and numbers: your service node's public key. This public key is used to identify your service node on the list of registered and operational service nodes. Select and copy the public key.

You can now jump onto [lozzax.observer](https://lozzax.observer/), open the full list of active service nodes, and use Cmd+F/Ctrl+F to check if your service node's public key appears in the list.

### Step 7: Unlocking your stake

Service Nodes will continually receive block rewards indefinitely until a stake is unlocked or the service node becomes deregistered. To unlock your stake, simply open the Lozzax GUI Wallet and navigate to the Service Nodes &gt; My Stakes tab. You can then click Unlock for any stake you wish to unlock:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/screen_shot_2021-01-24_at_18.46.34.png)

You can also unlock your stake by running the following command from the [Lozzax Command Line Interface \(CLI\) Wallet](../lozzax-wallet-guides/cli-wallet-commands.md):

```text
request_stake_unlock <service node key>
```

The service node will expire 15 days \(10800 blocks\) after the unlock is requested, and your staked $LOZZAX will then become unlocked after expiry.

For pooled nodes, any contributor can submit an unlock request. This will schedule the service node for expiration. All locked stakes in that Service Node will be unlocked 15 days \(10800 blocks\) after the unlock is requested. Once an unlock is requested, this process can not be undone or prolonged. Service node participants will continue receiving rewards until the node expires.

[Deregistrations](service-node-deregistration.md) can be issued at any point during the active lifecycle of a service node, including during the period after requesting an unlock. Deregistration removes your service node from the network, and your stake\(s\) become locked and unspendable for 30 days \(21600 blocks\) from the block in which the service node was deregistered.

Receiving a deregistration **after** participant\(s\) have already requested an unlock overrides the 15-day \(10800-block\) stake unlock time, and sets the unlock time to 30 days \(21600 blocks\).

print_locked_stakes
```

## **Updating your binaries**

When a new release is available, upgrading is as simple as syncing with the repository:

```text
sudo apt update
```

Then installing updates using:

```text
sudo apt upgrade
```

> Note that this will install both updated lozzaxd packages _and_ any available system updates \(this is generally a good thing!\).

During the upgrade, all instances of `lozzaxd` will be restarted if they are currently running in order to switch to the updated `lozzaxd`.

If for some reason you want to install _only_ Lozzax package upgrades but not other system package updates, then instead of the `sudo apt upgrade` you can use:

```text
sudo apt install lozzax-storage-server lozzaxd lokinet-router
```

## Conclusion

Well done! Your service node is configured, operational, and will now begin receiving rewards.
