# ðŸ’¡ Introduction to Lozzax

**Lozzax** is a privacy financial token which is built using the **Monero** Source code which we aim to build our own platform. We are remaining a proof of work coin with fast speed and good mining capability. Transactions using LOZZ is absolutely anonymous with the use of ring signature which means all transaction are not visible to the naked eyes this makes the receivers and senders amount not known publicly. This ideal is the same with the banking systems but more of an improvement of the system. Lozzax also uses same mechanism like Monero to hide the sender and receivers values with help of the Bulletproof as well as the receivers stealth address. With the help of Dandelion++ the Senders Internet Protocol address is also hidden from the naked eyes.
