# ðŸ—º Overview

Lozzax was fork from [OXEN](https://lozzax.io) blockchain with lozzax using majority of lozzax network features like Service node and Lokinet. Our blockchain is maintained by the [Lozzax Service Node network](lozzax-service-nodes.md), a network of blockchain nodes operated by members of the Lozzax community. Running a service node requires [_staking_](../using-the-lozzax-blockchain/lozzax-service-node-guides/staking-to-shared-service-node.md) â€” which means voluntarily locking â€” a certain amount of $LOZZAX tokens.

The staking requirement to run a service node is currently fixed at **25,000 $LOZZAX** or **6,250 $LOZZAX** for a shared node.

In exchange for maintaining reliable and trustworthy blockchain nodes, node operators periodically receive rewards in the form of $LOZZAX tokens.

The Lozzax blockchain also boasts [Blink](blink-instant-transactions.md) invented by the Oxen teamâ€” truly private, instant transactions. Blink allows you to make transactions with all the confidence Monero enthusiasts love, but with a 1 second transaction time. Blink gives $LOZZAX the potential to be used as a true means of value exchange â€” not just storage â€” in a way no other coin can match.
