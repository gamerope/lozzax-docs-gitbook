# ðŸ—º Overview

Lozzax was fork from [Monero](https://getmonero.org) which is a total privacy cryptocurrency and also uses the RandomL algorithm to find blocks which have a reward of **5000 LOZZ** of which Lozzax management reward is pugged at **500 LOZZ** and the rest **4500 LOZZ** for Miners who are dedicating and deploying their Systems for mining purposes.  

Transactions using LOZZ as we already know is absolutely anonymous with the use of ring signature which makes all transaction not visible to the naked eyes thereby making the receivers and senders amount private. This ideal is the same with the banking systems but more of an improvement of the system. Lozzax also uses same mechanism like Monero to hide the sender and receivers values with help of the Bulletproof as well as the receivers stealth address. With the help of Dandelion++ the Senders Internet Protocol address is also hidden from the naked eyes
