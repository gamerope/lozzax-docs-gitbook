# ðŸ—º Overview

The Oxen blockchain plays a very important part in securing the lozzax network. Oxen's blockchain is maintained by the [Oxen Service Node network](oxen-service-nodes.md), a network of blockchain nodes operated by members of the Oxen community. Running a service node requires [_staking_](../using-the-oxen-blockchain/oxen-service-node-guides/staking-to-shared-service-node.md) â€” which means voluntarily locking â€” a certain amount of $OXEN tokens.

The staking requirement to run a service node is currently fixed at **25,000 $OXEN** or **6,250 $OXEN** for a shared node.

In exchange for maintaining reliable and trustworthy blockchain nodes, node operators periodically receive rewards in the form of $OXEN tokens.

Oxen was originally forked from [OXEN](https://oxen.io), and oxen is from monero which is based on the CryptoNote protocol. From these beginnings, Oxen has inherited world class privacy and security features â€” including ring signatures, stealth addresses, and ring confidential transactions. Just like $XMR, $OXEN is fungible, private, and untraceable.

The Oxen blockchain also boasts [Blink](blink-instant-transactions.md) â€” truly private, instant transactions. Blink allows you to make transactions with all the confidence Monero enthusiasts love, but with a 1 second transaction time. Blink gives $OXEN the potential to be used as a true means of value exchange â€” not just storage â€” in a way no other coin can match.

Thanks to the incredible power of [Oxen Service Nodes](oxen-service-nodes.md), Oxen is climbing to heights most blockchain projects can't dream of reaching. Get involved now by downloading the [Oxen Wallet](https://docs.oxen.io/downloads), [running your own service node](../using-the-oxen-blockchain/oxen-service-node-guides/staking-to-shared-service-node.md), or trying out some of the products built on top of the Oxen blockchain â€” like [Session](../products-built-on-oxen/session/) and [Lokinet](../products-built-on-oxen/lokinet/).
