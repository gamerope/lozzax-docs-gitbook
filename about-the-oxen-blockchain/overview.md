# ðŸ—º Overview

The Lozzax blockchain plays a very important part in securing the lozzax network. Lozzax's blockchain is maintained by the [Lozzax Service Node network](lozzax-service-nodes.md), a network of blockchain nodes operated by members of the Lozzax community. Running a service node requires [_staking_](../using-the-lozzax-blockchain/lozzax-service-node-guides/staking-to-shared-service-node.md) â€” which means voluntarily locking â€” a certain amount of $LOZZAX tokens.

The staking requirement to run a service node is currently fixed at **25,000 $LOZZAX** or **6,250 $LOZZAX** for a shared node.

In exchange for maintaining reliable and trustworthy blockchain nodes, node operators periodically receive rewards in the form of $LOZZAX tokens.

Lozzax was originally forked from [LOZZAX](https://lozzax.io), and lozzax is from monero which is based on the CryptoNote protocol. From these beginnings, Lozzax has inherited world class privacy and security features â€” including ring signatures, stealth addresses, and ring confidential transactions. Just like $XMR, $LOZZAX is fungible, private, and untraceable.

The Lozzax blockchain also boasts [Blink](blink-instant-transactions.md) â€” truly private, instant transactions. Blink allows you to make transactions with all the confidence Monero enthusiasts love, but with a 1 second transaction time. Blink gives $LOZZAX the potential to be used as a true means of value exchange â€” not just storage â€” in a way no other coin can match.

Thanks to the incredible power of [Lozzax Service Nodes](lozzax-service-nodes.md), Lozzax is climbing to heights most blockchain projects can't dream of reaching. Get involved now by downloading the [Lozzax Wallet](https://docs.lozzax.io/downloads), [running your own service node](../using-the-lozzax-blockchain/lozzax-service-node-guides/staking-to-shared-service-node.md), or trying out some of the products built on top of the Lozzax blockchain â€” like [Session](../products-built-on-lozzax/session/) and [Lokinet](../products-built-on-lozzax/lokinet/).
