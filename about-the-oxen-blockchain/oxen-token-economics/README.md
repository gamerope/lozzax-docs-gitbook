# ðŸ“Š Token economics

The Oxen network is run by a decentralised network of incentivised nodes called [service nodes](../oxen-service-nodes.md).

As the workhorses of the network, service nodes get the lion's share of the reward: **11,880 $OXEN per block**.

This results in the creation of **11,880 $OXEN per day**.

Because of the nature of [Pulse](../pulse-pos-on-oxen/), a large proportion of $OXEN's total supply is locked in service nodes and unavailable on the market. On top of this, our research has shown that people earning rewards through staked nodes are **much** more likely to hold their tokens and continue participating in the network than those who earnt their tokens via mining.

These two qualities help increase buy pressure and decrease sell pressure in $OXEN markets, respectively.
